### Q 1.explain five operators used in python
a.Arithmetic operator-includes python operators for basic mathematic operations

b.Relational Python Operator- carries out the comparison between operands. They tell us whether an operand is greater than the other, lesser, equal, or a combination of those.

c.ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR-An assignment operator assigns a value to a variable which may manipulate the value by a factor before assigning it. We have 8 assignment operators- one plain, and seven for the 7 arithmetic python operators

d.Python logical operator:-These are conjunctions that you can use to combine more than one condition. We have three Python logical operator – and, or, and not that come under python operators

e.python identity operator:-These operators test if the two operands share an identity. We have two identity operators- ‘is’ and ‘is not’.

####Q 2.Python strings


Explain 2 built-in methods for strings

a.capitalize()-Capitalizes first letter of string

b.count(string,beg=0,end=lenstringCounts how many times str occurs in string or in a substring of string if starting index beg and ending index end are given

#####PYTHON DICTIONARIES


Q3 a.define a dictionary as used in python programming

 A Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. Each key-value pair in a Dictionary is separated by a colon :, whereas each key is separated by a ‘comma’.

b. list five dictionary methods

i.clear()-Removes all the elements from the dictionary
 
ii. copy()-Returns a copy of the dictionary
 
iii. fromkeys()-Returns a dictionary with the specified keys and values
  
 iv.item()- a list containing a tuple for each key value pair
 v.values()-Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary
